# Clustering a point layer
Clustering aggregates point data for certain zoom levels, generalizing otherwise busy maps. As you zoom in, clustered data points will disperse, adding specificity.

Rather than devise the code to cluster a dataset yourself, all you need to do is add some additional code libraries to your map. While you could download the [Leaflet.markercluster plugin](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster){:target="_blank"} directly to your computer/workshop data folder and link it locally just like you link your datasets, it's far easier to simply link the relevant libraries in the `<head>` element of your map HTML document. Remember, this is how we powered our map with Leaflet to begin with. After adding the **Leaflet.markercluster** libraries, we will then use this function to cluster our dataset.

For more documentation on Leaflet.markercluster, see [here](http://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.markercluster/){:target="_blank"}.

## Add `Leaflet.markercluster`
In the `<head>` element of your map document, at the very bottom, add the following. Be sure to scroll-right to get all of it. 

Copy/paste
{: .label .label-purple}
```html
  <!--marker cluster libraries-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.markercluster@1.4.1/dist/MarkerCluster.css">
  <script src='https://unpkg.com/leaflet.markercluster@1.4.1/dist/leaflet.markercluster-src.js'></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.markercluster@1.4.1/dist/MarkerCluster.Default.css" />
```

## Add point layer as cluster group
In the `<script>` element of your map's `<body>`, locate the codeblock that adds and loads Public Art as a point layer.  Either delete this block, or, more preferably, comment it out. In its place, copy and paste the following code. 

Copy/paste
{: .label .label-purple}
```js
//  add art layer as cluster group 
    var markers = L.markerClusterGroup();

    L.geoJSON(art, {
      onEachFeature: function (feature, layer) {
        var popupContent =
          "<img src='" + feature.properties.ImageURL + 
          "' width='200px'/><br><b>Title: </b>" + 
          feature.properties.Title + 
          "<br><b>Artist: </b>" + 
          feature.properties.Artist
        layer.bindPopup(popupContent);
      },
    }).addTo(markers);
    markers.addTo(mymap);
```

<br>

*Congratulations! That's it! Your point layer should now be clustered.*
