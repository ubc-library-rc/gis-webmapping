# Online Platforms for Web Mapping
Online platforms offer browser-based tools for making web maps. This option requires *no coding* and poses the lowest learning barrier.  We will now introduce 2 online platforms for webmapping: [Google MyMaps](https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/) and [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/). After demonstrating how to add and style layers in each interface, you will then have a chance to choose one to make a map with. 


To Do
{: .label .label-green }
Before we begin, please ensure you have a [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) account. If you don't already have a Google account, creating one for the purposes of using MyMaps is optional. Both accounts are free to make, and the platforms we will use are free as well.

## Google MyMaps
We recommend Google as a web mapping platform for its *Google MyMaps service  only*. With [Google MyMaps](https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/), you can create simple maps with drop pin locations or import data layers. Here's an example:

#### Google Advantages and Disadvantages
{: .no_toc}
 - Google MyMaps is very straightforward to use. If you want to quickly make a map, this option might be fore you. It is beginner friendly and requires no code. 
 - You can adjust the visibility options to enable collaborative editing. Because the Google Maps interface is so widely used - added bonus of being intuitive to potential collaborators and users. 
 - Data privacy is a concern, though you can adjust what attributes are visible on popup. 
 - Limited customization 
 - Data must be formatted to `.csv` or `.kml`. use [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20) to easily convert vector data online from shapefile and geojson format to csv and kml.  
 - While the Google Maps platform offers a panoply of mapping tools including [dynamic maps](https://mapsplatform.google.com/maps-products/dynamic-maps/), you must *be very careful about surreptitious charges*. For example, while the [embed maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started?hl=en) is free with unlimited usage, you must sign up for Google Cloud to use it. Google Cloud is only free for 90 days, after which you will be charged $200 monthly. In our opinion, beyond the simple drag-and-drop visualizations offered by Google MyMaps, it is recommended to invest your time and energy in learning a free and open-source option like uMap or Leaflet (detailed below).

## uMap
[uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) is a free and open-source platform that allows you to create web maps using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. You can then embed these maps into an existing website, or simply share the link to your final map with collaborators and audiences. With uMap, you can choose from a variety of basemaps, and even upload and add data layers of your own!
